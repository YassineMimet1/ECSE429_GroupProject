Charter:
---------------------------------------------------------
Identify the capabilities and areas of potential instability in the REST API Todo List Manager application. Focus on testing the functionality related to managing `todos` using `curl`. This includes creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting `todos`, as well as checking data consistency and error handling.

---------------------------------------------------------

--> Next, we'll attempt to identify areas of potential instability.

- I tested using various methods, such as missing headers, using a string instead of boolean for the 'doneStatus' field when creating / updating a todo object.
E.g. I ran this: 
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4567/todos \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "doneStatus": "notABoolean",
    "description": "Invalid boolean for doneStatus"
    }'
And this was the output: 
    {"errorMessages":["Failed Validation: doneStatus should be BOOLEAN"]}

I also tested simultaneously creating todos with the following command: 
    for i in {1..20}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:4567/todos \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "title": "Simultaneous Todo '$i'",
    "doneStatus": false,
    "description": "Testing concurrency"
    }' & done
Result: 
    The program performed flawlessly, outputting the JSON format for all 20 objects as expected.

I also tested an undocumented method like PATCH to update the fields:
    curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4567/todos/5 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "title": "Updated Title with PATCH"
    }'
Result:
    Did not update the title correctly.
